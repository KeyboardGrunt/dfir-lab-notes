I'm starting with a training exercise to get the training wheels off: https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2025/01/22/index.html

The background is that a coworker has downloaded a suspicious file after searching for Google Authenticator.

### The tasks for this pcap are as follows:
- What is the IP address of the infected Windows client?
- What is the mac address of the infected Windows client?
- What is the host name of the infected Windows client?
- What is the user account name from the infected Windows client?
- What is the likely domain name for the fake Google Authenticator page?
- What are the IP addresses used for C2 servers for this infection?

Opening the file the first thing I do is check Export Objects to see what files may have been recorded. I notice a teamviewer download from 10.1.17.215 to 5.252.153[.]241. Based on the Unit42 post on LinkedIn that followed this training exercise confirms that the destination address is in fact the C2 server. We seem to have skipped ahead a bit. This does indicate that the source IP is the infected Windows host. But let's keep digging to confirm it.

When digging through the TCP streams I found a name "shutchenson" on stream 7. It seems quite likely to be a user account name since it's communication from the likely infected host.

As one of the first packets of the pcap we can see that the likely victim host 10.1.17.215 announces itself as DESKTOP-L8C5GSJ. It doesn't take much digging to find the MAC address of the likely victim host in the packets themselves.

After looking for the earliest http traffic involving the C2 server which we easily identified, I was able to go back through recent TCP streams for the website the user went to. The website was google-authenticator.burleson-appliance[.]net and posed as a Google Authenticator page.

### Suspected victim client:
- Victim IP: 10.1.17.215 
- Victim MAC: 00:d0:b7:26:4a:74
- Victim host name: DESKTOP-L8C5GSJ
- Victim user account name: shutchenson

- Domain name for fake authenticator: google-authenticator.burleson-appliance[.]net

- IP for C2 server: 5.252.153[.]241

All in all, a pretty straightforward phishing attack, easily identifiable through packet analysis. I recognize that this is deliberately made simple because it's a training exercise. The real traffic might have been encrypted under normal circumstances, and perhaps multiple C2 destinations would have been used.
